It's a repository that contains a set of challenges in DevOps teaching. The objective is to help DevOps educators to teach DevOps. Some of theses challenges are found in the paper [Challenges and Recommendations in DevOps Education: A Systematic Literature Review](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3422392.3422496) published at the academic conference **SBES '20: Proceedings of the 34th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering**.

</p>


### [Curriculum](https://github.com/devops-education/Challenges-in-Devops-Education/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acurriculum+label%3Achallenge-existed+)

```
The Curriculum theme is related to the content, hourly load and the number of 
subjects needed to use DevOps. The relationship between the DevOps discipline 
and the prerequisite disciplines of this subject is also considered, as well 
as the interaction with the others of a software engineering course.
```
