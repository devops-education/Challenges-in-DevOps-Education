It's a repository that contains a set of challenges in DevOps teaching. The objective is to help DevOps educators to teach DevOps. Some of theses challenges are found in the paper [Challenges and Recommendations in DevOps Education: A Systematic Literature Review](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3422392.3422496) published at the academic conference **SBES '20: Proceedings of the 34th Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering**.

### Curriculum
- DevOps still received minor attention in higher education.
- The time available to teach CD and CI is devoted to other concepts
- Devops mindset should be considered to fine tune curricula.
- Teaching DevOps is multidisciplinary and therefore crosscutting the traditional course boundaries.
- The little time available to teaching complexities of CD and CI.
- Courses teach “Dev” rather than “Ops”

### Tools
- DevOps tools are new and time-consuming for a universitary lecturer.
- Some devops tools involve learning curve.
- DevOps tools are complex.
- Many DevOps tools for teacher to learn.
- DevOps overhead of keeping up with the industrial state-of-the-art at universities is often too high.

### Assessment
- Teaching DevOps mindset is difficult to assess.
- DevOps increases evaluation workload for teachers.

### Classes preparation
- There is little research into effective teaching pratices for incorporating DevOps into traditional software engineer courses
- Lack of a proper and sound theory of DevOps
- DevOps has not yet standardized with the Software Engineerigin Body of Knowledge
- Limited research in teaching DevOps


### Devops concepts

- Students have difficulties in explaining IaC
- Teachers need to learn dev and opt activities
- The main challenge was to find ways of emphasizing the Ops part of the approach.
- Teach DevOps mindset / cultural
- Teachers need to learn operations.
- CD and related concepts are complex.

### Environment setup
- DevOps requires complex and laborious architectures.
- Setup the tools and workflows increases the effort for educators.

### Pedagogy
- How to set up the DevOps approach itself from scratch.
