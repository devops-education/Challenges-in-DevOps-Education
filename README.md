### [Curriculum](https://github.com/devops-education/Challenges-in-Devops-Education/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acurriculum+label%3Achallenge-existed+)

```
The Curriculum theme is related to the content, hourly load and the number of 
subjects needed to use DevOps. The relationship between the DevOps discipline 
and the prerequisite disciplines of this subject is also considered, as well 
as the interaction with the others of a software engineering course.
